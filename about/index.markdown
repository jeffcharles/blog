* VBA (various spreadsheet automation tasks)
* SQL (some web development experience with TSQL and PL/pgSQL)

Testimonials:

> Jeff has an amazing and rare talent as a developer. He "gets it". He proved himself early on and was a critical member of the mobile team this term. Without his contributions we could not have delivered the quality of product we did. Super excited to work with him again in the future.
