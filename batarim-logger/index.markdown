title: Batarim Logger
---
Batarim Logger is an open source application that will log various utilization statistics (e.g., overall CPU and RAM usage) into a CSV file along with what applications were using the most CPU and RAM at a given time and what window was focused. This CSV file can then be analyzed to determine if there are any problems with resource utilization levels, if any applications are stressing the hardware, or for any other purpose that you would like.

## System Requirements

At the moment, Batarim Logger is compatible with Windows Vista 32-bit and 64-bit, Windows 7 32-bit and 64-bit, and most modern GNU&#47;Linux 32 and 64 bit operating systems running on an Intel or AMD processor with X11 installed. The focused window feature requires GDM as the login manager (the default with most desktop Linux systems running GNOME), though the rest of the application will function normally if that requirement is not met.</p>
